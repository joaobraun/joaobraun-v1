# Notes 
So while learning web development concepts and how to create a webpage for myself, I decided it was time to have my own page using only the basic knowledge of ```javascript```, ```html``` and ```css``` I had at the time, also only the basic tools, no frameworks or nothing. 


## Future
Although is good to put things in practice, I think I have to step up and I will replace this in the future. All things considered this was created in the beginning of my journey as a software developer, I'm still in it but I'll make it better.
